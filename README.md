This program was created because at my work place, we cant really install software from online unless it passes IT check. So I took it to my own hands and coded my own screen capture program (with help from stack overflow for the screen capture part) while I put in the automation and manual modes. 


Functions:
The program is tasked to take a photo every hour based on how the user runs the file. In automatic mode, the program will check the current date to determine if it will run a different schedule. In my cause, sunday and monday-friday is a different schedule while saturday is set to manual due to scheduling conflicts. In manual mode, the user will provide the start time for the program.


PLEASE NOTE: This is still very jank but the code can be customize to the users preference. I will be adding a section where the user can change the variables to their liking but also make it no be shit.
